Finally! I am inside this stupid mansion.1
Why does the requirement of the stupid entrance exam...1
consist of eliminating a demon. Just Japan Things I guess.1
Anyway, I am finally inside! Time to slay the demon.1
It is quite dark, I shall use my chakra to turn the lights.1
*Chant a chakra spell* LIGHTS COME TO ME!!!1
...That did not work!1
Oh. A light switch.1
Welp, I probably need to replenish my chakras.1
Let me take out my onion and banana drink to replenish it.1
...I must have forgotten to bring it with me.1
Lucky for me, I brought along my trusty holy water gun.1
But it not effective enough to eliminate the ghost yet.1
Now if only there is some broken gun part somewhere.1
Which I can use it to upgrade my gun.1
How convenient of it to appear in this secluded mansion.1
Which no one have ever visit for years.1
Now that I think about it, I thought ghost hate light.1
Then why does the ghost still stay here?1
Just Ghost Things. I guess.1
If there is no walls blocking me...1
Why can't I just walk to the door?1
So many question, so little answers.1
*Insert Pathetic-Whimpering sound here*1
I feel my chakras are returning to me, at a very slow rate.2
I wonder what level is this. *Look at top left* Oh.2
Then where is my health? *Look at bottom left* Oh.2
Where are the stuff that I collected? *Look at bottom right* Oh.2
My holy water gun is getting stronger each time, I upgrade it.2
Now that I think about it... I can only walk on the carpet.2
Which is weird...maybe the floor is lava. Who knows?2
I just notice the ghost is actually not a ghost.2
It is a grim reaper.2
Ok, enough chit chat.2
Let continue this stupid "quest" of mine.2
I can feel it. My chakras is returning back to me.3
Third level huh... I am almost there, I hoped.3
Just a few more levels, I think.3
I pretty sure a new ghost will show up here.3
Better defeat the boss as soon as possible!3
I still have Korean dramas to watch.3
That what my instinct tell me.3
Well level 4 here, I come!3
Ok, level...BOSS LEVEL?!4
THAT IS WAY TOO FAST ISN'T?!4
HELLLOOOOOO LEVEL DESIGNERS! WHERE IS LEVEL 4?!4
*sigh*Fine, Boss Time.4
I don't even have my chakras replenished yet.4
*Insert Cute-Pathetic-Whimpering sound here*4
Yay, boss hype...4
